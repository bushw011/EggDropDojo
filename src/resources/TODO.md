![Plan](Plan.JPG)  

### Todo
The todo is as follows:  
- [x] EmptyNestException.java
- [x] Egg.java
- [x] EggDrop.java
- [x] Get rid of Egg.java
- [ ] Add feedback about loosing egg (another error?)
- [x] Add feedback about being outside of the building. It will throw an index out of bounds exception. This will need to be documented.
- [x] Create array that shows where people have selected and make a method to send.
- [x] SampleDesign.java (not to be pushed to github)
- [ ] Make README
- [ ] Implement workspace.clj
- [ ] Update documentation  
- [ ] Add description of Egg, and EggDrop in workspace as a comment  

### Guidelines
For each file, there should be:  
* TDD style with tests in **UtilsTest.java**  
* JavaDoc Comments for each method  

### README  
This should contain:
* An explanation of the problem  
* Where they should   
* How the constructor works
* How the drop method works, how it works with Egg.java, the exceptions that can occur, and  how to try catch them.
